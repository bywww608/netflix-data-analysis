 Netflix Data Analysis

This project explores the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset to uncover trends in content type, release years, top production countries, and movie duration distributions.  
It demonstrates essential data analysis and visualization skills using Python — a great showcase for aspiring Data Analysts.


 Project Overview
This notebook performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Netflix data to answer questions like:
- How many Movies vs. TV Shows are on Netflix?
- Which countries produce the most titles?
- How has Netflix content grown over the years?
- What is the distribution of movie durations?


 Tools & Libraries
- Python 3
- Pandas – for data cleaning and manipulation  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn – for data visualization  
- Jupyter Notebook – for interactive data exploration

Key Insights
1.Movies dominate Netflix’s catalog compared to TV shows.

2.Content production surged after 2015, indicating rapid platform growth.

3.The United States produces the majority of Netflix titles.

4.Average movie duration centers around 90 minutes, with most between 60–120 minutes.

Future Improvements
Add genre-based analysis (e.g., most common genres by region).

Analyze rating distributions and audience preferences.

Build a simple dashboard for interactive data exploration.
